watch-plz
=========

Ensure all of your repositories are watched.

### why

- My current employer also uses github
- They have lots of repositories
- I don't want to watch all of the repositories
- So I uncheck the `Automatically watch repositories` setting
- I then forget to watch my own repositories

### usage

Grab a token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=watch-plz&scopes=notifications,public_repo).
If you want to watch private repositories you'll need the full `repo` permission.

Modify `DONT_WATCH` in the `watch-plz` script.

```bash
GH_TOKEN=... ./watch-plz --dry-run
```

### how I use it

I use [github actions scheduled builds] to run this periodically.
